# Implementations-of-Multi-Agent-Reinforcement-Learning
Summary of MARL research paper with open-source implementations for characterizing MARL training time breakdown, speed, etc.

### Notes:
- Decentralized Learning assumess that each agent does not have full access to all the state and reward info of other agents. Agents usually do not share policy parameters (antonym: Centralized Training (+ Decentralized Execution, CTDE)).
- Pre-defined Communication assumes that "who can talk to whom" is pre-determined and not to be dynamically learnt/changed during training (antonym: Learnable Communication).
- Partial-Structured Communication (antonym: All-to-all Communication)
